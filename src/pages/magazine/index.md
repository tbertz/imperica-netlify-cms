**Combining insight with intelligence, humour with hard analysis and comment with candour, Imperica Magazine is simply what we want it to be: a great monthly read.**

Although our roots are firmly in the creative industries and technology, the magazine has a much broader brief, covering everything and anything regarding the world around us.

Articles for the first issue include:

* Huel, and Silicon Valley's craze for food replacements
* Millennial founders - myth versus reality
* Postcards from the Phillippines
* The Snooper's Charter
* How to solve the problem of fake news
* The psychological effects of the selfie
* Copyright: necessary, evil, or necessary evil
* Art, science, and climate change

Imperica Magazine is online-only. Kindle owners can place an order through their local Amazon online store.

The price is £2 (apx €2.28 / $2.62).

We are currently moving to a new ordering system. If you’d like a copy of Imperica Magazine in EPUB or PDF, simply email <mailto:hello@imperica.com> and we’ll email a copy to you (we’ll figure out a means of payment).
