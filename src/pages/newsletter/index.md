The Imperica newsletter is a weekly digest of all things interesting from around the web, featuring the rather brilliant Web Curios from Matt Muir. 

For those who are less familiar, imagine having your skull trepanned, a RAID storage array inserted into it with the best of the web from the past week, and then being asked to write a coherent narrative on everything that your head contains. That goes only some way towards describing the link, video and comment frenzy that is Web Curios.

The newsletter is sent out on Friday, at around lunchtime in the UK.

And all that you need to do to receive it is to sign up below. You'll also be able to read it here on the Imperica website too.
