**"New knowledge for creative polymaths"** - [Peter Cochrane](https://www.imperica.com/en/peter-cochrane-ambient-intelligence)

Imperica is an online magazine which covers topics in and around contemporary culture. This is done in a way for the benefit of our main audience: those in the marketing and communications industry. While our main focus is on issues with a relationship to contemporary digital technology, we cover a wider range - pretty much anything concerning the life (lives?) we live today comes into our range.

Fundamentally, we're all about exploring ideas: exploring, dissecting, and reviewing them. We aim to be critical without being negative; analytical without being boring. Think of us as being a really useful scrapbook for planners, strategists, and digital heads/leaders.

We also occasionally run events, usually in a central London location. Our events have ranged from a [30th anniversary of the Sinclair ZX Spectrum home computer](https://www.imperica.com/en/horizons-the-sinclair-zx-spectrum-at-30), to the future of [home and mobile technology,](https://www.imperica.com/en/mirror-mirror) and one on the [past, present and future of wearables](https://www.imperica.com/en/wearable-horizons).

The Imperica newsletter is a weekly digest of all things interesting from around the web, featuring the rather brilliant Web Curios from Matt Muir. [Sign up here to receive it by email](https://www.imperica.com/en/newsletter).

Imperica is published by a company called Perini in a small office in the centre of Oxford. We do this sort of thing (that is, write, research, and produce) on a commercial basis too. These services are provided under our commercial agency brand, Perera. If you are interested in working with us, then visit Perera's website for more information.
